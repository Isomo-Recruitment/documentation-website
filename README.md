# Isomo Recruitment

## Hiring process could be better and we are here to implement some radical improvement

## Why Isomo?
The current recruitment process could be **time consuming** and sometimes contain **unintentional bias**. People can fall prey to collective decision making errors similar to â€œherd behavior", social hierarchy bias, and social conformity bias. These above challenges have become obstacles for companies that are striving to create a **diversified environment** through fair recruitment.

## Our Vision
We thrive to achieve **true equality** during the recruitment process by **filtering** out potential information that could lead to biases(e.g. Race, gender) from the applicant. This allows recruiters to simply analyze applications based on skillsets, experience, and performance.

## How did we do it?

Isomo was created by a team of data
scientists, analyst and game-changers driven by the goal of improving the **fairness**,
**efficiency** and **accuracy** of the hiring decisions we make.
We have conducted extensive research showing that **hiring bias** is real and could bring a negative effect to both companies and the individuals in many ways.
By moving beyond traditional approaches and using the
latest research insights, Isomo have the vision to
**simplify and streamline recruitment**. As a result, a **better company culture and performace** can be achieved.
